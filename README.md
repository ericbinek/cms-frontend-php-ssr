A server rendered web frontend for a schema.org aligned CMS, written in plain PHP 8.5.

There is no Composer and no `vendor/` directory. It serves semantic HTML from PHP's built in web server, with no template engine and no build step.

It renders list, detail, and create, edit, and delete views for 10 schema.org entity types such as BlogPosting, Person, and WebPage, talking to the CMS API over HTTP.

A conformance test suite defines the markup and behavior.

## Status: work in progress (v0.1.0)

This is an ongoing build-in-public project, shared only for community and communication purposes. Do not deploy it in production. Do not rely on its interfaces or data format remaining stable.

## No Composer

This is modern PHP without the dependency tree: no `composer install`, no `vendor/`, no framework. Strict types are on everywhere, the server is the built in `php -S`, and the `composer.json` here only describes the project, it does not pull anything in. Clone it and run it.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.5 or newer

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ericbinek/cms-frontend-php-ssr.git
cd cms-frontend-php-ssr
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running

```sh
php -S 0.0.0.0:4002 -t public src/server.php
```

The server listens on `PORT` (default 4002).

## Usage

Open http://localhost:4002/ in a browser. Each entity has a list view at `/<plural>`,
a detail view at `/<plural>/:id`, and create/edit/delete flows.

Configure the upstream API via the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable.

## Entities

- `BlogPosting`
- `Person`
- `WebPage`
- `ImageObject`
- `CategoryCode`
- `CategoryCodeSet`
- `DefinedTerm`
- `DefinedTermSet`
- `Comment`
- `WebSite`

## Testing

```sh
php bin/test.php
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This is a build-in-public project, so issues, questions, and ideas count as much as pull requests. If you send code, keep it dependency free with `declare(strict_types=1)` and no Composer packages, and keep the conformance suite green, since the tests are the contract. Run them with `php bin/test.php`.
