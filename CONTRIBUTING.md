# Contributing to cms-frontend-php-ssr

Thanks for taking a look. This is a build-in-public project at version 0.2.0, so it is still moving and contributions of every kind are welcome: bug reports, questions, ideas, and code.

## Ground rules

- Stay dependency free. The point of this project is the standard library, so please do not add Composer packages.
- The conformance test suite is the contract. If you change behavior, change the tests in the same pull request and explain why. Keep them green.
- This is not production software, and the README says so. Please keep that framing.

## Getting started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ericbinek/cms-frontend-php-ssr.git
cd cms-frontend-php-ssr
cp .env.example .env
```

Run it:

```sh
php -S 0.0.0.0:4002 -t public src/server.php
```

Run the tests:

```sh
php bin/test.php
```

There is no `composer install` and no `vendor/` directory: the standard library is all you need.

## Sending a change

1. For anything beyond a small fix, open an issue or discussion first so we do not duplicate work.
2. Keep each pull request focused on one thing.
3. Run the test suite locally and make sure it is green before you open the pull request.
4. Describe what changed and why.

## Style

`declare(strict_types=1)` everywhere, modern typed PHP, no framework. Match the surrounding code.
